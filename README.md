# Guide for This Activity
## Objective
Kindly note that the objective of this activity is `to familiarize ourselves with the basic operations of GitHub repo,` since we will be using it throughout the project we have to execute.
## Actions
You are expected to do `two (2)` things basically:
- Make a simple code and commit it for everyone to see.
- Comment on another team mate's code (N.B: you should comment on at least 1, though you are more than welcome to comment on more than 1 OR all).

## Deadline
Now that we have the repo (special thanks to Pete), we have between `now and Sunday` to complete this exercise.

## All the best Team :smile: !
## Its @Peter Otanwa Just testing the waters..
